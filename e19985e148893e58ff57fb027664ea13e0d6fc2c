This would mean, that in the current form we would have to save the contents of Chunk each time we add/remove a block inside a chunk.\n\nInstead, I propose a better solution. Just save each chunk when it is destructed. This way we won\u0027t cause any disk usage overhaul each time a voxel is created/destroyed.\n\nOf course, here comes the question - what if our app crashes so horribly that std::terminate will be called upon it. I would answer - our application is flawless, it does not crash. At least it should not. ;)",
